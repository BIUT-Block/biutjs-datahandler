This repository uses "leveldb" to store data locally.
There are four databases created: user_db, product_db, token_db, transaction_db
The default path is in './data' folder


user_db:
product_db:

token_db:
This database is used to store token block chain data.
This database contains many tables, and the name of each table is its corresponding block height.
All tables share one table structure, which is also the model of one tokenchain block.

"Here should have a figure to explain"


transaction_db
